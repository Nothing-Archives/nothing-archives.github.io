	<p>Hey there everyone!</p>
	<p>Today I am happy to announce something big both I and <a href="https://github.com/ExactExampl">ExactExampl</a> have been working on in the background.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p><b>PixelBuilds</b></p>
	<p> </p>
        <p>PixelBuilds is a reworked Pixel-like feeling ROM with quality of life features!</p>
	<p>Ongoing works are happening on the following devices:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li><a href="./../devices/taimen">Google Pixel 2 XL</a></li>
	    <li><a href="./../devices/flame">Google Pixel 4</a></li>
	    <li><a href="./../devices/sunfish">Google Pixel 4a</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>I intend to proceed with developing and shaping this ROM, whilst maintaining my previous device lineup at PixelExperience since my recent departure from the team.</p>
	<p>Our aim isn't to clutter any daily usage, instead to focus on the essentials of using your Android device.</p>
	<p>With the latest features from Pixel devices, merged directly into source, you'll be able to feel like a Pixel in no time!.</p>
	<p>A point worth mentioning, is that if you are enthusiast about my new project, feel free to join our Telegram groups!</p>
